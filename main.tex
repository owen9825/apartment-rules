\item  An Owner or Occupier of a Lot must not use the Lot, or permit it to be used, so as to cause a hazard to the health, safety and security of an Owner, Occupier, pet, or human guest of another Lot.
\newline
\newline This rule does not apply to scenarios where the \textit{hazard} is:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item  The growth of a plant
\item  The expression of political opinion
\end{enumerate}

\item  An Owner or Occupier of a Lot must not use a Lot or the Common Property for any purpose which is:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

\item  contrary to any Law from \href{https://www.merri-bek.vic.gov.au/}{Merri-bek City Council}, the \href{https://www.vic.gov.au/}{Victorian Government}, or the \href{https://my.gov.au/en/services}{Australian federal government};

\item  reasonably likely to cause or contribute to any loss or damage of a Lot or the Common Property; and

\item  reasonably likely to cause or contribute to any hazard.

\end{enumerate}

\item  An Owner or Occupier of a Lot must not permit any child under the age of 14 years, and owner whom the Owner or Occupier has control, to remain unaccompanied (by a responsible adult) in the underground vehicle parking areas, where there is a hazard or possible danger.

\item  If any person in a Lot is affected by an infectious disease which may require notification because of any law, the relevant Owner or Occupier must give notice to the Owners Corporation of this fact and any other information which may be required about the disease.

\item  Further to the above rule, the Owner must pay to the Owners Corporation the expense of disinfecting the affected lots (if that is necessary) and replacing any article or thing the destruction of which may be rendered necessary by that disease

\end{enumerate}

\item  Fire Safety including Emergency Procedures

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]

\item  Obstruction of Exits
\newline An Owner or Occupier of a Lot must ensure that Common Property and emergency exits from the Building or Lots are not obstructed at any time.

\item  Fire Control

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

\item  The Owners Corporation may secure and keep the Common Property and any Lots safe from fire or other hazards. This includes:

(i) permanently or temporarily closing off and restricting access to any part of the Common Property not required for access to a Lot or to its associated vehicle parking;

(ii) allowing part of the Common Property to be used for security purposes including monitoring security and safety of Lots, even if this means excluding Owners or Occupiers from using that part of the Common Property; and

(iii) restrict by means of key or other security device the access of the Owners or Occupiers of one level of the Building any other level of the Building.

\item  The Owners Corporation is responsible for the repair and maintenance of the fire safety system for the Development, which includes that part of the system situated within each Lot.
